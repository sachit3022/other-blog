There’s plenty of advice out there for PhD students and undergraduates, but very little for those pursuing a master’s degree. I want to share the lessons and practices that made my own master’s both successful and deeply enjoyable.
I was an average student in undergrad by all metrics. Yet during my master’s, everything changed — I published a paper in a top-tier conference, secured a machine learning job, and, most importantly, found genuine joy in what I was doing.
It took me two and a half years to graduate — longer than usual — but I’d call it a “half-PhD.” That journey transformed how I think, work, and live.
