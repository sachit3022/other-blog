There’s plenty of advice out there for PhD students and undergraduates, but very little for those pursuing a master’s degree. I want to share the lessons and practices that made my own master’s both successful and deeply enjoyable.

I was an average student in undergrad by all metrics. Yet during my master’s, I was somewhat considered successfull — I published a paper in a top-tier conference, secured a machine learning job, and, most importantly, found genuine joy in what I was doing.

It took me two and a half years to graduate — longer than usual — but I’d call it a “half-PhD.” That journey transformed how I think, work, and live.

### Why do I want to pursue a Masters degree?

Everyone should have an answer to this question. Even if you don’t know every detail at the start, you should have a guiding goal — a north star you want to reach. For me, that goal was to write a paper like [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02650) EMNLP paper I came across during an oral talk at the conference. What fascinated me wasn’t the final result, but the way the author reasoned through the problem to arrive at a solution.

If you’re lucky, you might discover your purpose early. But for me, it took a mix of exploration and exploitation. In my case, I read widely across economics, mathematics, design, and machine learning. I explored many resources available — attending [IIIT hyderabad summer school](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/summerschoolseries/), earning ML certification from  [IIT KGP](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/summerschoolseries/), joining paper-reading sessions, and online courses. That’s what ultimately led me toward research and the decision to pursue a master’s degree.

### Reasons to consider enrolling in a Masters program

**Dedicated time** to explore what you think you love. To explore any topic deeply—be it research or learning a new skill—allocating dedicated time greatly increases the chances of success in your pursuit. By enrolling in a master’s program, you are intentionally setting aside that time, thereby increasing your chances of building a career around what you truly love.

**Calculated Risk:** Research is inherently risky. But during your master’s, it’s one of the safest times to take those risks. If your idea fails, you still gain valuable research skills and earn a course-based degree. If it succeeds, the rewards—publications, recognition, and job opportunities—are often disproportionate to the effort. It’s a limited-downside, with huge upside.

**Freedom & Independence:** You’re free to choose the problems that interest you—or even to spend time developing a sense of what kinds of problems excite you. Unlike a corporate setting, you don’t have a boss assigning tasks. You control your direction, pace, and curiosity.

**Research Opportunity:** Professors are usually generous in giving motivated students a chance. At the master’s level, you’re often unproven and still learning how to do research, yet many professors are willing to guide you through that process.

**Access to smart folks:**  The research community has a selection bias of smart folks. You’ll find yourself surrounded by PhD students and peers who think deeply about complex problems. Ideas flow freely in such environments, and you’ll often find people willing to help you arrive at solutions together.

If you already have all of these—freedom, time, access to great mentors, and the ability to take risks—then you might not need a master’s degree.

During your master’s, you’ll constantly face two paths: the easy one and the challenging one. Always choose the latter.

The easiest way to earn a master’s is by completing your courses diligently.  Yet, in all my interviews, not a single person asked which courses I took or what grades I earned. In graduate school, **grades don’t matter — unless you mess them up badly.**

So how should you choose your courses? The purpose of a course is to find your collaborators. **Pick courses that could lead to research opportunities in a lab.** They’re the best way to demonstrate your curiosity, thinking process, and work ethic — and an easy way to convince a professor to take you on as a student. Sometimes, go with your gut; you might discover unexpected collaborations.

**Projects** make up a large part of your graduate courses, the difficulty of the projects depends on you.  In one of my courses, we were given three options: write a literature survey, reimplement a research paper, or explore something novel. To my surprise, most students chose the first two. Those are, in my opinion, the worst choices you can make—safe, short-lived, and rarely pursued beyond the course. 

When choosing projects, avoid the common pitfalls:

1. Most projects last only a few weeks and are soon abandoned.
2. Many projects focus are superficial — like running all algorithms in SciPy and announcing that Random Forests outperform the rest, or training Faster-RCNN for hand detection.

These projects are good practice and earn solid grades, but they rarely contribute anything new to the community. If you work on a typical course project, no one will remember it — not even your professor. Such projects are rarely revisited and are often discounted during PhD admissions or job interviews. 

So how should you pick a project? 
**Design your project as a piece of a larger research question** When you do that, your audience naturally expands — it’s no longer just your professor, but the broader research community. What truly matters is working on a problem for a long time. Research is, at its core, a long and evolving project. Almost every meaningful research idea begins as something small — a class project, a weekend curiosity — and grows deeper as you continue to explore it. The more you question, refine, and iterate, the more original and interesting your work becomes.

Case Study: My own research journey started in the most ordinary way — with a class assignment. My advisor was teaching Score-Based Generative Models, and the assignment was to implement a simple version of one. After finishing the assignment, I was curious on how well score based generative models generalize? —  a question closely tied to my broader research interest in generalization. Initial experiments revealed that these models don’t generalize well. From there, the solution emerged naturally from understanding why they fail. In fact, most of the later experiments grew directly from a fork of the base code provided for that original assignment.


### Research huh!

Skills that ~~makes you a great scientist~~ you learn while working on a research project:
1. Developing a taste of what problems are worth solving?
2. How to generate ideas and see them to execution?
3. How to critique ideas?
4. How to prioritize ideas?
5. How do you navigate during uncertain times?
6. How to communicate effectively?
7. How to own a project end to end?

Whether you apply to PhD or pursue industry route, these skills are extremely valuable. If your path is to do a PhD, you have no option but to try your luck at research. If you aim for industry, these same skills, if mastered, help you stand out and land exceptional roles.

Case Study: I landed multiple job offers. In my experience, companies have 2 critical rounds of interviews, although they are called with different names
1. Breadth + Reasoning
2. Depth 
Some examples questions I was asked as a part of Breadth + Reasoning
> Can you improve planning in autonomous driving cars? 
> Given a robot build a 3D reconstruction of a house and design an optimal path to traverse the entire house? 
> How do you generate social media feeds to drive users to a goal? 

These are very open-ended research questions. For example, if you are solving a problem of goal driven social media. You can formulate the problem as a sequence of next post prediction given the user context. You can formulate it as a next token prediction in LLMs. As the goal is not differentiable, the reward from the goal ( visiting a store offline ) can be formulated as a RL problem. 

The Depth Round is very straightforward; pick one of the projects and explain it to me. You don't need 100 project, you need one that you can explain in it to very detail. The deeper and clearer the problem and the solution the better. Naturally research will give you an edge.

So you are convinced that research is the way to go So now getting into details
 
How to pick a School? 

Pick the school with higher rankings on csrankings.org in your field of study. 
> The better the school, the higher the opportunities to succeed. For example, you have a wide range of professors and problems to pick from. If you don't like a professor or problem, you can switch.
> Reputation of the school matters a lot more than you think,  hiring trends of college grads also tend to support this hypothesis. 
Pick the school with a large ratio of PhD students to Masters students. This is a signal that school is serious about research and does not treat masters as a cash cow. You will also find many opportunities for research and teaching with less competition. 

However, the application process to a masters program is random. You won't end up getting what you want. However, to improve the odds, have an honest SOP and reach out to the professors in addition to submitting applications.

Case Study:  Most top schools reject me, but Michigan State accepted me.  MSU is a unique school with a very good ranking in Computer Vision, and has a high ratio of PhD students to Masters ~1.0. If you consider specialization in Computer Vision MSU makes a very good case. 


## What ~~professor~~ lab to join?

Karpathy, in his blog has listed all the factors to consider as an Advisor. Most apply to the Masters student, but some of the factors I want to highlight and need to think differently for a masters student.  

Labmates: This is the most important, especially if you are a masters student. The most you are gonna learn and spend time with is your labmates. So pick a lab which has the most smart and helpful folks. If there is a tradeoff between smart and helpful, always pick the helpful bunch. In such a lab, ideas flow openly and you can latch onto some ideas and connect some dots. You can also  learn the research process,  i,e how vague thoughts get converted to a publication. 

Case stdy of hy lab mates matter;

Interest and style of problems: Due to the short duration of masters you can't change the style of the lab, you better choose the lab that aligns with you. Each and every lab has published papers, Does any of the papers excite you or wish you to write a paper like it. the more such papers by the group the better. The excitement can come from exact problems being solved or the style problem has been approached or for some other reason you loved the paper. 

Case Study: I choose Dr. Boddeti’s lab due to the emphasis on scientific thinking. I decided to hang out in the lab, although I was fired, because my large chunk of learning at MSU was from my labmates.

Lead vs Follow: My first question with my advisor was “Will you work on something independently or collaborate with one of the students? If I were you, I would choose the first one.” So I would reciprocate the same advice for the following reasons. 
You get to interact with professors, who are a well trained version of a PhD student Freedom to pursue interests you care about. PhD students are trying to establish their niche so if your interests diverge, you are on your own as PhD students are not knowledgeable in the research process or care about other areas. On the other hand professors are more experienced in guiding you with the research process and in general professors are a better discriminator of your idea.
A recommendation letter personally from the professor is of immense value. Although this is a derivative rather than something you plan on.
Caveat: Professors are not very hands on and will give you a very high level and you don’t operate at the same level as them. So you need to work hard on your communication. 

### Advice to succeed in your research endeavor 

**Nothing beats hard work**

	I am an ordinary student. My engineering GPA is 7.30 and barely made it to a Masters’ program. On the contrary my labmates were extremely talented, top of the class with GPA of at least 9.0 and very good scientific contributions. The only way I was closer to my dreams is by working extremely hard. There were months with just 3 hours of sleep. I barely took a holiday, I showed up every single day and made small progress in the direction of understanding the problem and that made the difference.  Even if ideas fail just show up every single day, It does not make any sense in the 

Case study; I have tried 3 different problem statements to tackle, 1. Fairness, 2. Unlearning, 3. Adversarial optimization. They are sort of inter-connected and fall under the general umbrella of Generalization. I could not come up with some different ideas. 

There are no shortcuts, you have to work extremely hard to make progress. Smart work is an overrated word. In my opinion, if you add hours into doing something, slowly you get smart and the work you do eventually becomes smarter. 

**Own your research**

Most masters think it is the professor's research. To spoil it for you It’s not, the professor does not care about you or your research endeavour. It is your responsibility to solve the problem. Professors are already swamped with deadlines. Why should the professor give you his precious time?  you are competing for his/her attention so you have to fight for his attention. Treat you as the one leading the research project and the professor is there to help you in your journey. ( Read you and your research )

Writing and communication is key to success

I can't emphasize enough how important communication skills are. They are needed not just for research but for all aspects of life. By Communication I don't mean language, more of a story telling. To this day, I struggle with this, hoping to improve it. Maintain a log or running latex document and just dump your ideas, theorems, proofs, code links you have wriitte  or notability if you are ipad person.

**Don't work solo**
Work with a PhD student in the lab, since this would be your first research paper, there are some formulae that you need to learn to be successful. I made a mistake of not collaborating with PhD 
How to structure your thought process. 
Literature review: You will not know some literature, they will help you with a few seed papers. 


They have already seen ideas for publication, they know the process to make it as a publication. 
3. Finally,  you will get a companion, who you can discuss  the approach regular and most of my ideas were refuted in the process, because I cant convince someone and they can cover your blind spots that you can’t spot before some reviewer raises them. 
4. Sometime you will reach a mental block, they will add insights and releases from it.
5. Sometimes you spend going down a rabbit hole only to realize later that you you missed a small logic train. So as you are communicating, you will make your hypothesis solid and don't end up wasting 2 days. 
They will help you with your weakest skill 

**Review papers**
	> Researchers who know you even though you don’t have a paper can suggest you as a reviewer
> During reviewing you tend to question everything written by the author, later you can compare if you had any blind spot from the other reviews written for that paper. Questioning research works is an important skill because asking the right question is almost 80% of the job done. 


**Mental and physical health**
	
Research is a personal journey. Once you complete a research project you are not the same person that has started. No one cares about your success, or your battles. You will fail many many times and you will learn a lot more from it. Don't take things personally, Take learnings and keep working on things that you believe are true. 

Case study: I have failed in 3 research endeavours, I was unable to generate ideas and my ideas were outdated and was bad at communication. These were the reasons that got me fired. Rather than crying about it, I was back the next day and realized the mistakes and continued to make progress. 

**Luck is a big factor**

My entire research journey is attributed to pure luck, attributing to anything other than that is stupidity. 
Luck:
Helpful Labmates: I was lucky to find them
Diverse lab and lot of open problems floating around for me to pick out
Deep Learning course
Advisor: My advisor asked me the right questions, answering them was much easier.
My advisor saw me struggling and assigned one of the PhD student.


### Fall in love

I would encourage you to fall in love, particularly if you are doing a thesis-based master’s. It might sound unrelated to academics, but it can indirectly help you succeed in them.
You can talk to your partner about research, and sometimes that will help you think more clearly and communicate better. At other times, it helps to take your mind off research completely, explore the city together, or do something simple and monotonous. It’s the mental reset your brain didn’t know it needed.
Sometimes, you need emotional support with your context to navigate highs and lows of the research career. An added benefit is having a working girlfriend who can look after the poor researcher. My girlfriend supported me at a crucial point, allowing me to save time and mental energy that would have gone into a part-time job.
