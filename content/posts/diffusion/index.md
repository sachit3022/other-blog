Diffusion models have been extensively studied, and there is a lot of literature available to learn from [\[1](#1) - [4\]](#4). In this blog we will try to explain intutively with the example of 8-mode gaussian generation.

### Generative modelling
We can think of generative modeling as learning a transformation function that goes from a known distribution to the unknown. For example, suppose we want to sample from a Gaussian distribution. We first sample from a uniform distribution and then apply the inverse CDF of the Gaussian to get the new random variable whose distribution is Gaussian. We can express this as follows: for a random variable $z$ with a known distribution (uniform in our example), we learn a function $f$ (the inverse CDF of the distribution we want to sample from). Then, we sample $x$ such that $x = f(z)$, where $z \sim U[0,1]$. Since we have no knowledge of the inverse CDF of an unknown sampling process, we approximate it with a neural network.

### Diffusion as VAE

The image dipicts how VAE and diffusion are connected. In VAE we go from Image domain to the latent domain. We enforce the latent to be gaussian $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$  by constrianing latent with KL divergence. Then the decoder learns the inverse transformation of it. This notion of VAE is very similar to
