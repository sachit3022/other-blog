{{< quote source="Jony Ive on creative process" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KywJimWe_Ok" >}}
Despite doing this for a long time, I've been nearly 30 years at Apple, I remain completely in awe, completely enchanted by the creative process. I love the unpredictability and I love the surprise. The whole process is fabulously terrifying and so uncertain. But I love that on Monday, there's nothing. There is no idea there is no conversation, the room is silent, there's certainly not a drawing. Prototypes are way in the future. On Monday, there is nothing, but on Wednesday, there is. No matter how partial, how tentative. Now, the problem is: which Wednesday? And, so given the unpredictability we obsess about the process. We paid maniacal attention to the past hoping to better understand and discover new ways of having productive ideas

This quote is applicable to research, as research is a creative endeavor. I have observed this in my work: the first Monday of 2024 was very quiet, but nearly six months later, on a Wednesday, I had the faintest idea, though it was quite crude, later resulted in ICLR 2025 submission.

If you believe something, don't give up on it, until you understand why it is wrong! ... Don't let people tell you it's nonsense, if you can't see why it is nonsense
